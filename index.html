      <br><br>Her body of work relies less on recognizable visual patterns as mark-marking, and more on <span>consistent, epigrammatic</span> <font size="2;"><sup>3&nbsp;</sup></font>&nbsp;conceptualizations.
      <br><br> This notion is illustrated in both the making and its result. She seeks not to possess a distinctive mark but have <font size="2;"><span>recognizable solutions.</span><sup>4&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></font> Elisa believes design should operate as an armature for content and depart from
      individual overtness. <br><br>She is currently <font size="2;"><sup>5&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></font><span>freelancing</span> and has recently completed her BA at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p>

  <p>"When the Whirlwind Begins",
    Exhibition designer, 2019</p>

  <p>This group exhibition of Philadelphia artists is the culminating gesture of the Applied Curatorial Practices class taught by The Anderson Curator/Director Chase Westfall. The class is made up of six undergraduate VCUarts students who were nominated to participate by their respective departments.
  "When the Whirlwind Begins" offers a thematic survey of some of the most relevant, challenging, and exciting work being made in Philadelphia today. The exhibition explores the energy of transformation that emerges in times of chaos and change. Artists were selected through student research and a series of site and studio visits made in Philadelphia during the Fall semester.</p>

  <p>"Sight, Site, Cite",
  Tabled, 2019</p>
  <p>As designers, we often deal with what is visible. How can we exploit this tool of visibility? How can we use the action of publishing to bring content, community, concerns into view? Sight, Site Cite, is a publishing fair that addresses these concerns of visibility, of accessibility through publishing. Designers created individual an imprints, mission statements, and markers to produce and distribute three editions under.</p>

  <p>"Garo Manga 1966-1971",
  Research Project & Publication, 2019</p>
  <p>Compiled in this publication is Garo covers, and stories from 1966 to 1971 (Edition 23 to 90). Through my research, much information about Garo is inaccessible due to language barriers, the rarity of the publication, and assuming some copyright obstacles. However, amateur translators who have procured some copies have been able to upload dates and contributors for several of the editions. Also incorporated in the publication are scans from “scanlation” translators specified beforehand. This particular translator produced an archive of scanned covers and stories. Thus, I was able to pair the covers, the contributors, the dates, and the stories to the correct publication. This publication additionally, stands as a publication that would be ever-changing as more information becomes accessible to the general public.</p>
